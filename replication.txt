Basic Steps:

	1. First, we need to stop any running instances of mongod.
	2. Then, we need to start a new instance using the "--replSet"
	3. Then we need to connect to this mongod instance using the mongo shell.
	4. In Mongo client,we issue the command rs.initiate() to initiate a new replica set.
	5. To check the replica set configuration, we issue the command rs.conf(). To check the status of replica set issue the 	command rs.status().
	6. use rs.add() to add secondary mongod instances to replica set.



Command:

	port used:- 27017
	db path used:- "C:\data\db"
	name of the replication set used: "replication_set_1"


	replication commands:

		a) mongod --port 27017 --dbpath "C:\data\db" --replSet replication_set_1
		b) mongo --replSet "replication_set_1"
		c) rs.initiate()
		d) rs.add("mongod_new_instance:27017")
